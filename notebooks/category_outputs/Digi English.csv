6477c36f540bc5d16fa5e2b1,Digi English,OpEd by the Ambassador of Japan to Romania Hiroshi UedaIn Tokyo President of Romania Mr Klaus Iohannis has just signed the bilateral Strategic Partnership Statement together with Prime Minister of Japan Mr Fumio Kishida This is a historic milestone in the relations between our countries Last year President Iohannis eloquently said that it is not the geographical distance that matters but the proximity of values and the ability to act in mutual support when needed During my mandate in Romania I have found that while we might be geographically far apart the closeness between our peoples is genuine because we share the same values freedom democracy respect for human rights and the rule of law Russias aggression against Ukraine and other global challenges are putting our values under pressure and we have to defend them togetherI arrived in Bucharest on a snowy December day in  The Christmas lights were already on but people did not look too cheerful  we were in the middle of a Covid  pandemic I was very curious about a country with a vibrant and fastgrowing economy that joined NATO and the EU From the very first meetings I was amazed by my interlocutors passion for Japan and by their hospitality In a way I felt at home In all the countries I have ever visited I have never heard the word konnichiwa Buna ziua as often as in Romania Not only my counterparts but also young people impressed me with how open they are how many languages they speak and how interested they are in broadening their horizons and getting out of their comfort zones These encounters made me convinced that Romania has a very bright future Romania is a young democracy an important member of the EU and NATO and shares the same values with Japan Since signing the Joint Statement on the Renewed Partnership between Japan and Romania in  the relations between our two countries have been moving forward at an accelerated pace The year  marked the th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries The year  marks the fulfillment of a promise to bring bilateral relations to the level of a strategic partnership which the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe discussed with President Klaus Iohannis during his visit to Romania in  as Japans first Prime Minister  The objective of the Strategic Partnership is to create a framework for facilitating increased political and security dialogue economic and development cooperation as well as culture science and technology research and development innovation and peopletopeople contacts We hope this will serve as a catalyst to boost trade and business between our countries Japanese investment in Romania and peopletopeople exchangesJapanese companies are already here More than  Japanese companies are operating in Romania creating more than  jobs In addition we are involved in many of Romanias flagship projects such as the Braila Bridge the largest suspension bridge in Romania and the third longest in the EU which is being built by a partnership that includes the Japanese company IHI Another prime example of our cooperation is the access railway to Bucharest International Airport the socalled M metro line which will be built with Japanese funding In the fields of culture arts and sports the popularity of Japan is remarkable including the Japanese language literature martial arts tea ceremony pop culture anime and manga The respect for each others culture is mutual The participation of Japanese theatre artists in the Sibiu International Theatre Festival has become a regular spectacle every JuneIn the new international context marked by Russias invasion of Ukraine the signing of the Strategic Partnership takes on even greater significance Likeminded nations need to unite with each other The invasion is absolutely unacceptable and shakes the very foundations of the international order based on the rule of law Japan has swiftly implemented sanctions against Russia and pledged a total of USD  billion in aid to Ukraine Romania the Republic of Moldova and other neighbouring countries We continue to stand with you We reject any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in any regionRomania as a key member of NATOs Eastern Flank and the Bucharest  format has responded admirably providing assistance to refugees supporting Ukrainian grain shipments setting up the humanitarian hub in Suceava providing energy and financial assistance to the Republic of Moldova and many more In particular we have witnessed the warm welcome given to Ukrainian refugees by the Romanian people This reminds me of how immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake in  our Romanian friends invited the children of Fukushima to Romania to alleviate their suffering Long before the invasion began on an August afternoon in  with the Danube river breezing gently we celebrated together with our Romanian friends both the th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries and the inauguration of the main construction of the Braila Bridge not far from the Ukrainian border At that moment the wind rustled on the river and the flags of Japan and Romania were raised high above the bridge Today with the signing of our strategic partnership we are building another robust bridge together,"[OpEd, by, the,

6477c46b540bc5d16fa5fab1,Digi English,Mykhailo Podolyak adviser of the Ukrainian president Volodimir Zelensky stated in an interview for Digiro that the losses suffered by Putin after the successful Ukrainian counteroffensives in Eastern and Southern Ukraine represent the beginning of the end for the Kremlin leader Podolyak assumes that the situation in Russia will explode like a powder kegAlexandru Rotaru President Zelensky declared that after Putin signed the annexation decree for the four Ukrainian regions there is nothing more to discuss with Putin and the negotiations will be held only after the Putin regime comes to an end How would that occur considering that Putin has multiple clones as you mentioned clones that could continue his legacy as much as they wantMykhailo Podolyak It is not about the duplicates or triplicates of Putin The problem is that Russia is in an early state of major turbulence a situation that will lead to a revolution Russia is losing the war Russia will be defeated and once the occupied territories are reclaimed the political transformations in Russia will become more acute There might be street protests and even if the present Russian political power is still able to control such riots once those forcibly mobilized will start to die in great numbers it will cause a great deal of pressure from inland towards the Russian political system Russia is now forcibly mobilizing a lot of fresh recruits in order to compensate the great losses inflicted in the ranks of the professional army Once arrived on the frontline these illtrained conscripts will just make Russian casualties grow at a faster paceThere are several stress factors here the territorial war is almost lost From now on Russia will only retreat an extremely negative factor The second stressor shows a significantly high death toll among those forcibly mobilized Russian recruits There is a considerable difference between a professional army and a forcibly mobilized one this will be an extremely devastating stressor for the Russian regions The third stress factor stays in the increasingly tougher sanctions for the Russian FederationAlexandru Rotaru Do you mean that given Putins actions the regime will collapse by itselfMykhailo PodolyakThere is no regime that can collapse by itself There will be irreversible processes from within The sanctions will dramatically decrease life quality especially when people are unable to leave a country that has its borders closed as we believe that Russian will seal their borders after huge waves of people ran abroad trying to evade military draftingThe forth stress factor is that conflicts already began inside Putins eliteFor instance Prigozhin and Kadyrov gangs are already in an open conflict with Russian generals and with Shoigus henchmen In the regions with different ethnic majorities there are already volunteer groups forming therefore all these factors together with the defeats in Ukraine will explode like a powder keg and it will all turn to an extremely tough revolutionary scenario This wont happen by itself but it will happen as a result of all those factors from within and abroad that will impact the Russian FederationAlexandru Rotaru All things considered the great majority of Russian oligarchs still support Putin Do you believe that Putins successor will be an outsider that has Western views similar to Navalny Someone who looks towards the civilized world and wishes for the people from his country to live similarly or there will be someone with identical views as PutinMykhailo Podolyak No certainly there wont be anyone else like Putin and all this Russian elite  Putins inner circle  will turn to dust legally economically and so onNow as far as the oligarchs are concerned I doubt that any of them truly supports the war The Russian oligarchs even if they publicly support the war they are dishonest because they will suffer extreme costs due to this war loosing all their wealth and businesses They are having major problems with their businesses as we speakFinally who could form a new govenrment of the Russian Federation Of course this could be Navalny or someone else I dont believe we can speak today about specific names but I believe this is the moment when the liberal part of Russian politics that was denied from the right to vote and debate can restructure and quickly seize power from Putins regime that is inevitably in a free fall Editor   Ștefania Vîlcu,"[Mykhailo, Podolyak, adviser, of, the, Ukrainian, president, Volodimir,
